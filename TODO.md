# Things to fix, change or add to Scratch Cat Tales

- Make the intro
- Make jumping then going into the opposite direction just not work
- Add the turning animation
- Improve the inventory
- Merge the text engines and make the font switchable
- Remove the Konami code for release

## Bugs
- The `QuickFont` and `Font` fonts are swapped, making text generally hard to read except for in the pause menu, where it uses the correct font
- Signs may continue writing text even after the dialogue box disappeared. To replicate: run past the `walk into a wall to climb` sign in level 1-1
- Text engine is generally buggy
- Having a minimum of 1000000 coins will cause the world map counter to overflow. This can be seen in game by spamming the konami code or by being an absolute try-hard.
